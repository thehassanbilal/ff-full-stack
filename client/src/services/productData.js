    coverImg: blogOneCover,
    detail: `Many high school freshman and sophomore athletes become obsessed with ways to gain muscle mass. For some, getting physically stronger and bigger is a means to improve their sports performance. Others are interested in getting jacked simply to attract the opposite gender. But young athletes cannot focus solely on getting those percolating pectorals and massive “guns.” They must develop a wide variety of skills, such as strength, speed, agility and endurance—while also gaining muscle and filling out their frames.

The truth is that most high school strength and conditioning programs are non-existent or severely underfunded. Many young athletes are forced to figure out the training aspect under the guidance of their parents or team coaches, who unfortunately are often unqualified as strength coaches. This leads many young athletes into training programs that are better suited for Mr. Olympia bodybuilders than high school athletes who need to build a strength training foundation by developing important motor skills needed for their specific sport.

The following is not a complete workout program, but it does provide training and nutrition guidelines that coaches and parents can follow to help their young athletes gain muscle and develop as athletes.`,

However, when it comes to building mass with bodyweight training it’s all about progression and if you want to get yourself stronger, faster, and in this case, BIGGER, you’ve got to force your body to adapt by making things harder over time.

Now, before I get into sharing my top 3 methods on how you can build up more athletic muscle with just bodyweight training alone, let me make myself clear in stating the fact that if you truly want to build more athletic mass in the fastest time possible, bodyweight training alone isn’t going to be your best bet for this.

Obviously training with external weights like barbells, dumbbells, and kettlebells will always be your best way to slap on functional mass quick, but that doesn’t mean you can’t put those tools aside for a while and still achieve gains in powerful muscle.

So, with that being said, let me dig into some of my favorite methods for adding mass onto your frame with just bodyweight training.`,

Crazy Muscle is aware that people seeking to better themselves are bombarded with ads that try to reduce elegant science down to talking points that fit neatly into a banner ad or magazine page.

    detail: `1. Start strength training
Strength training is a type of exercise in which your muscles contract against resistance. It builds muscle mass and increases strength over time, and it usually involves lifting weights.

Research reveals that strength training has multiple health benefits, especially when it comes to fat loss.

According to a review of 58 studies, resistance training for at least 4 weeks may help decrease body fat by an average of 1.46%. It may also significantly reduce body fat mass and visceral fat, which is a type of fat that surrounds the organs in your belly (1Trusted Source).

Another study showed that 5 months of strength training was more effective at reducing body fat in adolescents with obesity than aerobic exercise alone (2Trusted Source).

Plus, resistance training may help preserve fat-free mass, which may increase the number of calories your body burns at rest (3Trusted Source).

According to one review, resistance training boosted people’s resting metabolic rate compared with a control group, while aerobic exercise had no effect on metabolism (4Trusted Source).

Doing bodyweight exercises, lifting weights, and using gym equipment are a few easy ways to get started with strength training.`,

    title: 'Ways tell whether you’re losing fat',
    coverImg: blogfiveCover,
    detail: `It’s common practice to track your weight loss progress using a scale.

While this can be helpful, most scales don’t differentiate between fat loss and muscle loss.

For that reason, tracking only your weight isn’t a reliable way to determine whether you’re losing fat or muscle and in what amounts.

Conversely, a body fat scale can provide a more accurate picture of your body composition by measuring the percentage of fat and muscle you have.

You can also use skinfold calipers to estimate your body fat percentage, but this takes practice to ensure accuracy (1Trusted Source).

Many weight loss programs claim to help you lose weight quickly and easily.

However, it’s important to realize that a significant amount of this weight may include water and muscle losses (2Trusted Source, 3Trusted Source).

Losing muscle can be detrimental, as muscle is a crucial component of your overall health.

Maintaining a healthy percentage of muscle has several benefits, such as regulating healthy blood sugar levels, maintaining healthy fat levels — like triglycerides and cholesterol — in the blood, and controlling inflammation.

Indeed, several studies have linked a higher fat-to-muscle ratio to chronic diseases like metabolic syndrome, heart disease, and diabetes (4Trusted Source, 5Trusted Source, 6Trusted Source).

Maintaining your muscle mass may also reduce your risk of age-related muscle loss, which results in frailty and potentially disability (7Trusted Source).

Additionally, the more muscle you have, the more calories you burn at rest. This is the main reason why men generally have higher calorie needs than women (8Trusted Source).

Consequently, losing weight in the form of muscle can decrease the number of calories you burn at rest, making it easier to regain any weight you lost in the form of fat (9Trusted Source).`,

    title: 'How to lose fat and maintain or gain muscle',
    coverImg: blogsixCover,
    detail: `There are a few simple ways to ensure you’ll lose weight in the form of fat and either maintain or gain muscle mass.

These include eating plenty of protein, exercising regularly, and following a nutrient-dense diet that puts you in a slight calorie deficit.

Eat plenty of protein
Protein is an important nutrient for a variety of bodily functions.

It’s necessary to make enzymes that help with digestion and energy production, regulate fluid balance, and support immune health, among other functions.

Protein is also important for maintaining the muscle you have and supporting new muscle growth, especially when losing weight.

In one 4-week study, young men were randomized to consume a low calorie diet containing either 0.55 or 1.1 grams of protein per pound (1.2 or 2.4 grams per kg) of body weight combined with an intense exercise training program (10Trusted Source).

While both groups lost a significant amount of weight, the men who consumed the higher protein diet lost 2.9 pounds (1.3 kg) more fat mass and gained 2.4 pounds (1.1 kg) more muscle than men who consumed the lower protein diet.

Importantly, the study found that high intensity resistance exercise followed by a high protein recovery snack made the most difference. Also, it limited the men’s fat intake to create a calorie deficit and maintained their carb intake for adequate exercise fuel.

And while eating plenty of protein with a reduced calorie diet without weight training may not help you gain muscle, it may help you maintain muscle while increasing fat loss.

A review of 20 studies involving men and women ages 50 years and older found that a high protein diet containing at least 0.68 grams per pound (1 gram per kg) led to more muscle mass retention and fat loss than a lower protein diet (11Trusted Source).

While protein needs differ depending on your age, health, sex, and physical activity level, consuming protein in the range of 0.45–0.73 grams per pound (1–1.6 grams per kg) of body weight per day can support muscle mass retention and fat loss with dieting (11Trusted Source, 12Trusted Source, 13Trusted Source).

For reference, the recommended dietary allowance for protein is 0.36 grams per pound (0.8 grams per kg) of body weight per day.
